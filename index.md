        <a href="https://plbc.itch.io/underground-rebellion">Undreground Rebellion</a>
        <p>
        <b>Underground Rebellion</b> is a 2D platform game, developed for PC, where the player must defeat his enemies stealthily or parry their attacks to tire them out, combining simple but challenging platforming. I worked as a Teach Leader, in a group of 4 people, on this university project, where our goal was to develop a 2D game. I developed the game's enemy AI, the narrative system, the scoring system and did the team's code review.

        <p>
        <b>Cinética Quimica</b> is a serious 2D point-and-click game that I developed and designed by myself for a friend's undergraduate thesis. The player combines different objects found in the lab to learn a little about chemistry, and then earns points by answering to a PopUp Quiz minigame.

        <p>
        <b>Nidavellir</b> is a 2D top-down RPG based on Norse mythology. Find your way out of Niflheim while facing a wave of enemies and a boss battle. This was the first game I worked on, where I worked with a group of 4 friends as a gameplay developer for a class project at university.
