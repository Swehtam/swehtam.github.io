      <p style="margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.5; color: #555;">
        <b>Underground Rebellion</b> is a 2D platform game, developed for PC, where the player must defeat his enemies stealthily or parry their attacks to tire them out, combining simple but challenging platforming. I worked as a Teach Leader, in a group of 4 people, on this university project, where our goal was to develop a 2D game. I developed the game's enemy AI, the narrative system, the scoring system and did the team's code review.
